# Credit Default Modeling Algorithm

This code was based on a term long project for Fintech Analytics with [Professor Roger M. Stein.](http://www.rogermstein.com/)
The model estimates the probability of default for 16,509 unique US banks between 1993 and 2016. You can view the [presentation for results and summaries.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lmo17sQmCSZZcxbjsNA2Jf_aAIZfIjjX26Mj7W7oXZk/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000)

## Methods used within the code:
- Winterization transformation of key variables
- Logistic Regression Modeling
- Bayesian Priors Calibration
- Bootstrap Testing
- Walk-forward Testing

## Scripting Languages and Libraries Used
- R Studio
- [GGplot2](http://ggplot2.org/): Great tool for data visualization and clean charts
- [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr): For dealing with data
- [lubridate](https://github.com/hadley/lubridate): Dealing with dates and stepping forward or back by quarters

## Instructions
I will need to update with instructions on how to fully use all of the functions but they are well defined in the beginning of the code.
